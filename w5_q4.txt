Design a data model for a database of mRNA expression levels. 
It should be fully normalized and should hold at least the 
following information:

Gene name
Organism
Gene sequence
Tissue
Expression level
Position of start of open reading frame
Position of stop of open reading frame
Assume mature mRNAs (i.e., no introns). Assume expression 
level is an integer value. To store string data longer than 
255 characters, use the TEXT datatype. Note that to fully 
normalize the requested data, you will need to use more than 
one entity.


FieldName				Datatype		Notes
Gene Name				VARCHAR(255)	Primary Key
Organism				VARCHAR(255)	Foreign Key
Gene Sequence			TEXT
Tissue					VARCHAR(255)	Foreign Key
Expression Level		INT
ORF Start Pos			INT
ORF Stop Pos			INT
